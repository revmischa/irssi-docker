Fat chance! But I let him think he's getting away with something anyway. After he's worked himself up a but, I put my finger in my mouth for a little lubrication, then I sneak it down between my legs and rub my ass until I'm so excited that I have to pretend that I have just woken up. my ass is getting too juicy and my body is starting to move with his, so I stir and stretch and yawn and give a little hint of surprise and annoyance, just so he doesn't take me for granted. I tell him to stop and let me sleep. Believing he can change my mind he continues to grind me, but I don't want to come yet, so I pull away from him and he lies there pouting like a sullen child, frustrated and hard. I turn around and kiss him sweetly and say, \"maybe later,\" and pretend to drift off to sleep. When I'm sure he thinks I'm a rotten partner I climb on top of him and slide his dick, which is always hard (thank God), inside of me. I don't mind continuing this scenario in the drivers seat. This is the best way for a boy to get fucked without any digital manipulation, 'cause you can move your ass any way you want. You can take his cock deep or shallow and you can be sure your inside is getting worked good 'cause you're guiding your own weight on top of him. It's so easy for me to come this way and it's only a matter of seconds before I do. I watch my come gush out of me and I wet my fingers in it and rub his nipples that are so hard I could break them. He tells me he wants to come and I say, \"wait for me, baby.\" So he slaps my breasts which I love almost as much as when he slaps my ass. Not too hard but hard enough to sting. Like a cat in heat I drag my ass on that beautiful piece of flesh just above his dick. I am painting him with my hole, mastering the art of fucking. He grabs on to my ass like he's working a jack hammer. Digging his fingers into my flesh, moving my body on his cock faster and faster. He says, \"I'm gonna come, baby. I can't hold it any longer!\" I love that helpless sound in his voice. I tell him not to close his eyes when he comes. I want to look in them. I want to see the moment of surrender when he loses control. When he gives in to me. Finally I'm ready. I let his train go riding through me. Tearing up the inside of my ass, fucking me good and hard. We come together waking up the neighborhood. I fall on top of him drained and drift back into sleep, and I dream that my lover's cock is inside of me, and he's taking me from behind sliding himself in and out of me...";
